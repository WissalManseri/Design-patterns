Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. These patterns provide proven solutions to specific design problems and can be applied to various software development projects. Here are some common design patterns in Java:

Singleton Pattern: This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to that instance.

Factory Pattern: This pattern provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Observer Pattern: This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

Decorator Pattern: This pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.

Adapter Pattern: This pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface that clients expect. This allows classes to work together that otherwise could not because of incompatible interfaces.

Command Pattern: This pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

Facade Pattern: This pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

Template Method Pattern: This pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.

These are just a few examples of design patterns in Java. There are many other patterns available, each providing a solution to a specific problem in software design.
